High scores (3) are reserved for contexts that are both precise in their information and easy to understand. Low scores (1) are for contexts where the information is vague or hard to comprehend.\\\\ndepth: Determine the level of detailed examination and the inclusion of innovative insights within the context. A high score indicates a comprehensive and insightful analysis, while a low score suggests a superficial treatment of the topic.\\\\nstructure: Assess how well the content is organized and whether it flows logically. High scores are awarded to contexts that demonstrate coherent organization and logical progression, whereas low scores indicate a lack of structure or clarity in progression.\\\\nrelevance: Judge the pertinence of the content to the main topic, awarding high scores to contexts tightly focused on the subject without unnecessary digressions, and low scores to those that are cluttered with irrelevant information.\\\\nStructure your JSON output to reflect these criteria as keys with their corresponding scores as values\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\nThe output should be a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\\\\n\\\\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\\\\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

High scores (3) are reserved for contexts that are both precise in their information and easy to understand. Low scores (1) are for contexts where the information is vague or hard to comprehend.\\\\ndepth: Determine the level of detailed examination and the inclusion of innovative insights within the context.

High scores are awarded to contexts that demonstrate coherent organization and logical progression, whereas low scores indicate a lack of structure or clarity in progression.\\\\nrelevance: Judge the pertinence of the content to the main topic, awarding high scores to contexts tightly focused on the subject without unnecessary digressions, and low scores to those that are cluttered with irrelevant information.\\\\nStructure your JSON output to reflect these criteria as keys with their corresponding scores as values\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\nThe output should be a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\\\\n\\\\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\\\\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.
